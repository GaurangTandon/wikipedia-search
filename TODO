- make a cache of stemmer; pystemmer does that: https://github.com/snowballstem/pystemmer/blob/master/docs/quickstart.txt
- search is very slow because of the compressed dump, even in the profiler, most samples that are taken are taken of the BZ2_readChar
- do thresholding on two wikipedia pages presence
- use champion list to speed up search
- after all this it might be possible that index size < 1/4th without actual compression - useful for search speed up
