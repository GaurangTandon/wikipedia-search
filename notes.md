## parsing

Is of two types: DOM and SAX. DOM parser first builds the complete in-memory representation of the XML file, and then allows you to iterate through its nodes. This consumes a lot of memory if the file is large. Examples: RapidXML, TinyXML, PugiXML.

SAX parser (Simple API for XML) is an event-driven online approach where handlers keep getting called as the parser is iterating through the file, like startElement, endElement, seenCharacter, etc.
